# WinUI3Preview3_Problems_DataGrid

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the DataGrid in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code crashes when the DataGrid is resized to have a scrollbar or has enough data to require the window to have a scrollbar.
